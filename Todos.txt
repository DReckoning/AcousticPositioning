Need to separate this work from the design project.


test 3

Easy 30 mins

* make the system print to csv

* make the system run completely from the config system.
* 	make the system configure the acceptable zone. (auto or manual)

make a uniform error messaging system for
	faulty data
	faulty inputs
	lack of sync

make the system work for 3d




Medium 2 hours

make the system handle dropped or false pulses mid run. (using a linear fit or something.)

make the system use the range relevance error weighting.

make the system run for 5, 6, 7 sensors.

make the system work for multiple rocks and multiple syncs




Hard days

make the system run real time and event based. 

make the system be able to localize one of its sensors based on multiple emitter points.

make the system work through pattern matching. 

make the system be configured without measurement of the sensor locations. 

figure out applications for mobile devices, internet of things, smart appliances/home.
